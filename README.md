# Ventus' Deku Tweaks

This is a mod for Majora's Mask: Recompiled, that tweaks Deku form in a few ways to make it more appealing to use.

Changes include:

- Infinite hopping on Water by holding A.

- Swimming when landing in water after using all deku hops.
    (This is toggleable for people who wish to void instead)

- Being able to use floor switches as Deku, and hold them down with its Elegy Statue.

Made using the Majora's Mask: Recompiled Mod Template.
